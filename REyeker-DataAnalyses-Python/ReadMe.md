#  REyeker DataAnalysis Python

Here a Python API is provided to analyse and visualise the REyeker data. For this purpose, there are various Python files in the "modules" folder. However, other libraries can also be used for analysis and visualisation. To get an insight into this, there are the various Jupyter notebooks, which are currently also actively used for data analysis. To see a concrete example, there is the branch "RecursiveVsIterative", in which the analysis for the corresponding study can be found.
