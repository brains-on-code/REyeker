Chord diagrams were used to visualise the Areas of Interest classification.
Bar charts with the respective transitions can be generated, but do not provide a good quantitative evaluation.
Inserting all transitions into a bar chart was quite confusing and not usable.
Therefore, the pie version of it was used.
The width of the sections in a diagram represents how often an area of interest was clicked on,
the transitions between the areas show which transitions were used how often. 

All snippets were classified first, using the respective lines of the snippet. 

In the case of the iterative:

['none' - no AOI,
 'main' - complete main method,
 'Iterative definition' - declaration of the method name,
 'Pre calculation' - calculations or conditions performed before the iteration, 
 'Iteration Condition' - condition of the iteration, mostly the loop head, 
 'Iteration Step' - calculations in the iteration, 
 'Return Result' - return or output of the result].

In the case of recursiob:

['none' - no AOI, 
 'main' - complete main method, 
 'Recursive definition' - declaration of the method name, 
 'Pre calculation' - calculations or conditions performed before the recursion, 
 'Recursive Condition' - condition of the recursion, mostly the termination criterion and the recursion start, 
 'Recursive Step' - calculations with the recursion, 
 'Return Result' - return or output of the result].


Then, all measures of visual attention were assigned to an AOI and subsequently two consecutive measures
of click data became a transition. Thus, all snippets of a class were visualised in a diagram.
A visualisation per algorithm is possible, but was not carried out in order to first assess the meaningfulness of the diagrams.
The interactive diagrams with the exact figures are in the folder REyeker-DataAnalyses-Python\results.
